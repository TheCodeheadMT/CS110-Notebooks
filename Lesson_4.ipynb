    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Use sequential logic to accomplish one or more tasks one after another\n",
    "- Use the input() function to get data from the user\n",
    "- Differentiate between integers, floats, strings, and Booleans\n",
    "- Use variables to store values of different data types including integers, floats, strings, and Booleans\n",
    "- Convert between data types appropriately\n",
    "- Use the built-in Python math operators to perform calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used in python to store values.  This is done by creating a name that starts with a letter or underscore (_).  The name can include numbers but cannot start with them, and they are case sensitive.  The name is then followed by an equal sign (=) and the value you wish to assign.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value in python has a data tpye common ones you will come across for now are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- integer - int - Wholes numbers (e.g., 0,1,2,3,4)\n",
    "- float - float - Decimal numbers (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)\n",
    "- string - str - Text (e.g., \"Hello\", 'Hi', '5', \"True\")\n",
    "- boolean - bool - True or False \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = ‘Ed’\n",
    "Name = “Hazeldine”\n",
    "rank = Major \n",
    "num_1 = 42 \n",
    "num_2 = “67”\n",
    "3rd_num = 29 \n",

    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a text data type that is surrounded by either single (```'```) or double (```\"```) quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation is joining strings together and is done by using a plus sign (```+```).  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "str_1 = \"Hello\"\n",
    "str_2 = \"World\"\n",
    "str_3 = str_1 + str_2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case ```str_3``` would end up being ```HelloWorld```.  There is no space between the words because concatenation just combines strings it does not add anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing is taking a specific character in a string and is done by using square brackets (```[]```) at the end of the string, **the index of all string starts at 0**.  To take the 6th character in ```str_3``` it would look like this ```str_3[5]``` to take the first character it would be ```str_3[0]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is taking a range of characters from the string it works similar to indexing.  Square brackets (```[]```) are still used, but within them the values will be ```[start:stop:step]```.  Start is inclusive and if it is index 0 then nothing is needed, stop is non-inclusive and if the stop is the last character nothing is needed, and step is how you are moving through the string it defaults to 1.\n",

    "The space between outputs comes from the separator (```,```) value, which defaults to a space. You can change this using the options. For example, to use a comma and a space: ```print(Q1, Q2, Q3, sep=', ')```. Using *sep=* changes the effect of a comma in the print statement. **This only works in print, not with strings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every print statement ends by default with a newline (```\\n```), meaning the next print will be on a different line. This option can also be changed by using ```end=```, just like you would use ```sep=```.\n",
